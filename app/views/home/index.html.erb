    <h2>The St. Botolph Neighborhood</h2>
    <p>The St. Botolph District was developed in the 1850's as a residential neighborhood and is a historical site protected by the St. Botolph Historic District Commission. It consists of 8 blocks east to west, and its boundaries are Huntington Avenue, Copley Place, the Southwest Corridor Park and Massachusetts Avenue. Because of its Back Bay/Prudential location closely bordering the South End (via the Southwest Corridor Park), its residents enjoy the benefits of easy access to many thriving commercial areas while enjoying the quiet ambiance of a comfortable residential neighborhood.</p>
    <p>The St. Botolph neighborhood is known for the diversity of both its residents and architecture, and it has continued that diversity while maintaining its historic character. Artists, musicians, professionals, and families live in historic brownstones and modern condominiums. Owners and renters live side by side and actively participate in protecting the neighborhoodâ€™s visual beauty and residential character.</p>
